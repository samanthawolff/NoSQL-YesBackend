  # NoSQL-YesBackend

  ![License: ](https://img.shields.io/badge/License--yellow.svg)

  ## Description
  For this project, I was tasked with creating back end API points for a social network web application. Using NoSQL along with MongoDB, I was able to create RESTful API's that best follow the CRUD operation. To see the application in action, watch this short video: https://photos.app.goo.gl/iBQiwTX2gkxuXUM38
